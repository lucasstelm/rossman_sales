# Rossmann Store Sales
## Forecasting sales using store, promotion, and competitor data

Rossmann operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers are tasked with predicting their daily sales for up to six weeks in advance. Store sales are influenced by many factors, including promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality. With thousands of individual managers predicting sales based on their unique circumstances, the accuracy of results can be quite varied.

This project aims to create a machine learning model that predicts sales revenue for any given store for the next six weeks. 

This business problem was first presented as a Kaggle competition and serves as an excellent entry point for getting started with regression models. The competition website can be found at:
